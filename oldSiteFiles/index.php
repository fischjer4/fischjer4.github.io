									<p>
										I’m from a small farming community where I spent my summers working on our family fruit orchard. 
										<img class= "mdl-shadow--6dp" src="JeremyFischer/Images/Orchard.jpg" width="35%" height="35%" border="0" alt=""  style="float:right; margin: 4px;">
										There is a joke that goes like this, “Do you know how to make a small fortune farming? Start out with 
										a large fortune!” That’s because being a farmer is hard work and depending on the year it doesn’t always
										pay off, especially for we smaller growers. On a farm you are always trying to find the most efficient 
										use of resources and figuring out how to fix things. I believe this is where my ingenuity and strong work 
										ethic came from. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I spent my winters at the ski resort 30 minutes from my home working as a ski and 
										snowboard instructor as well as a Children’s Learning Center attendant. 
										People from across the globe come to this mountain to work or to recreate, 
										so I interacted with and learned to communicate well with people having all kinds of 
										different personalities, temperaments and cultural backgrounds. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I’ve always been an active individual and throughout middle school and high school I wrestled 
										and played football. It was there that I learned the value of team. My experience was further
										 enhanced as the team captain where I acquired an understanding of the importance of strong 
										 leadership and personal sacrifice for the sake of the greater good. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I stumbled upon technology when I took a StRUT (Student use of Recycled Technology) class in high school. 
										This class was more hardware based than software and mainly consisted of tinkering with Arduinos and dismantling 
										broken computers. I became enlightened to what technology can do for people. I began researching 
										career paths that involve technology. After exploring all options, I knew that I belonged in the Computer Science field. The fact that 
										in Computer Science I can design, create, be the mastermind behind a solution that impacts people’s lives 
										and really see it come to life excites me!
									</p>
									<p>
										I’m in my third year now at Oregon State University and have been loving every bit of it. I have taken 
										advantage of every opportunity I have encountered here at OSU and have been fortunate enough to be a 
										part of the Engineering Leadership Academy and Oregon State’s ACM Student Chapter. I want to be a 
										part of something that is challenging and innovative. I believe that my background, technical skill 
										set, desire to learn, and involvement have set me up to excel in any situation that comes my way.

									At Autodesk, I worked in the Strategy and Research department under Pati Vrobel, Distinguished Research Engineer. We tackled a thin vertical 
									into the idea of the computer as a collaborator as it applies to simulation. What I mean by that is in the 
									future, the computer will no longer be acting as a tool. Rather, it will function more as a team member 
									that takes on jobs, runs those processes in the background, gives advice, and is more involved overall 
									in the experience. Think of Jarvis from Iron Man 
								</p>
								<p>
									In the mechanical realm before designs can be manufactured and turned into products, they must first be 
									simulated to assure the design meets the product's requirements. However, the designer is frequently 
									expected to set up the simulation and more often than not, unless they are familiar with that product’s 
									mechanics, they don’t know how to correctly set up the constraints and loads. Even if they get the 
									constraints and loads set correctly most won’t know how to interpret the results. Because of this, many 
									times minor designs are shipped off to the simulation analyst to be professionally tested. The simulation
									analyst will run the simulation, interpret the results, and then send the design back to the designer with 
									critiques. Involving a simulation analyst often creates a bottleneck in process design. Not to mention, 
									for minor designs this is a waste of company resources as the simulation analyst should be applying their 
									knowledge to more complex designs.
								</p>
								<p>
									In collaboration with Patti Vrobel and my team at Autodesk, I designed 
									and implemented a working prototype, Project Prospector, that runs in Autodesk’s Fusion 360 and attempts to
									solve this problem. Prospector automatically sets up and runs simulation in the background while the user
									is designing. Before I give an overview of the project I need to introduce a very powerful utility that 
									made this possible - Design Graph. Design Graph is a project coming out of Autodesk Research that
									uses machine learning and shape recognition to scan designs for their parts and cluster them based off 
									of their geometry. For instance, all of the screws will be in a cluster, the chairs in another, lamps in 
									another, and so on. Users can then explore these clusters when looking for part alternatives by giving 
									Design Graph their design and viewing all similar shaped alternatives.
								</p>
								<p>
									Here is a high level overview of how Prospector works. The user is designing in Fusion 360. Behind the scenes
									Prospector scans their design, queries Design Graph for similar parts and downloads them. Prospector then 
									scans those files for past simulation studies and uses that info to automatically setup and run the simulation 
									on the current design in the background. Imagine a chair being designed in Fusion 360. Prospector takes a
									snapshot of the design, ships it off to Design Graph which returns similar looking chairs. Those similar 
									chairs are then mined for past simulation studies. Let’s say that Prospector came back and found that
									ChairSim1 was the best choice for the user's design. Then Prospector would prepare the user’s chair 
									design for simulation using the info from ChairSim1. Once the simulation is done it is then shown 
									to the designer. All of this is done behind the scene without user interaction. 
								</p>
								<p>
									This project espoused the idea of computer as collaborator in the simulation realm. In the future, 
									if we could filter the simulation’s contours to something that is easier for the designer to understand, 
									we could increase a company’s productivity tremendously by cutting off the simulation analyst bottleneck.
									By shortening the time to manufacture, products get to market faster, increasing company revenues. 
									Prospector allows the designer to design, the simulation analyst to simulate complex designs, and 
									the computer to be used to its full advantage. By the end of the internship we had an awesome working 
									prototype acting as a spark to kindle the innovation behind the computer as a collaborator, opening the 
									eyes of many.
