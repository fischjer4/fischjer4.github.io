							I’m from a small farming community where I spent my summers
							working on our family fruit orchard. There's a joke that goes
							like this, “Do you know how to make a small fortune farming?
							Start out with a large fortune!” That’s because being
							a farmer is hard work and depending on the year it doesn’t
							always pay off. On a farm you are always trying to find the most efficient use of
							resources and figuring out how to fix broken equipment. I believe
							this is where my ingenuity and strong work ethic came from.

									The purpose of this RESTful API is to serve as the back-end for a Smart
									Farm system. The server is a Docker containerized Node.js and Express app,
									that utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate users, and MongoDB
									as its data store. The system as a whole has three types of <b>sensors</b>:
									<b>temperature</b>, <b>irrigation</b>, and <b>soil</b>. A varying number of these sensors
									are placed in each <b>block</b> on a fruit <b>farm</b>. The sensors send data to
									the server to be stored. As of now, irrigation sensors send the time
									irrigation was started and the time the water was stopped. Soil sensors
									send the volumetric water content, electrical conductivity, and the soil
									temperature. Temperature sensors send the temperature of the air. <b>Users</b>
									must signup and login. There are three types of users: Admins, general
									users, and sensors; each of which have different privileges within the API.
								</p>
								<p>
									Users can retrieve important statistics about their farm,
									such as the average irrigation time over the past month, the current
									soil and temperature data, average soil and temperature data over the
									past month, and more!

									Kora is a proof of concept project that integrates a
									natural language processing library into Autodesk's 3-D
									computer aided design software, Fusion 360. Kora is a
									speech-based virtual assistant for Fusion that lets
									users perform a subset of tasks within the product
									such as saving a document by verbally instructing it
									to perform the task. Kora offers users a tool that
									decreases the time required to achieve their goals
									within Fusion by offering an interface that runs in
									parallel with and complements the keyboard and mouse.
								</p>
								<p>
									Since the inception of publicly available computers
									until around 2006 society has interacted with computers
									in the same manner – keyboard and mouse. Recently there’s
									been a moving trend toward making computers and
									machines more interactive. Nintendo launched the Wii
									in 2006 and Microsoft’s XBOX division followed in 2010
									with the Kinect. Apple launched Siri in 2010 and Microsoft
									and Google followed shortly after with their smart assistants.
									Autodesk realizes the competitive advantage of having their
									products more interactive. This is what lead to Kora.
								</p>
								<p>
									Autodesk has the opportunity to gain much more from
									making their products more interactive than simply
									retaining and attracting users due to the new ease of use.
									From a data perspective, enabling natural language
									processing allows for a new addition to user data that
									is rich in potential! Instead of only collecting button
									clicks on dropdown menus and ribbon items, with a voice
									interface Autodesk would be able to collect exactly what
									the user is intending to do. This form of data collection
									rips away the ambiguity of the data.
								</p>

									This project translates a small subset of the Python
									programming language into the C&#43;&#43; programming language.
									This translator consists of two major components:
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Scanner</b>
									<br>
										The scanner is in charge of reading the input characters
										and creating a queue of tokens based off of them. A token
										is a label for the read input character(s). For instance,
										if <code>2018</code> was read, then the token <code>INTEGER</code> would be added
										to the queue. To create the scanner I used a tool called
										<i>Flex</i>. <i>Flex</i> is a tool that's widely-used for generating
										scanners. To implement a scanner using <i>Flex</i>, you must
										specify a set of regular expressions corresponding to
										patterns in your source language along with a set of
										actions to take when each of the patterns is matched.
										For example, the regular expression <code>&#8722;?[0-9]&#43;</code> will match
										any positive or negative integer. So, when a stream of
										input characters matches that regular expression (pattern)
										the token <code>INTEGER</code> is added to the queue. After running
										the <i>Flex</i> scanner on the input my translator has a queue
										of tokens that serves as input into the translators next
										stage, the parser.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Push-Parser</b>
									<br>
									The parser is in charge of consuming the tokens generated by the
									scanner and performing an action based of the sequence of tokens.
									For this I used a tool called <i>Bison</i> which easily integrates with <i>Flex</i>.
									I created a Push-Parser, so that each time a token is generated in
									the scanner, it is pushed to the parser for handling. I created a
									Grammar that <i>Bison</i> uses to act on the tokens. Essentially, a
									Grammar outlines what a certain sequence of tokens mean. So, if
									we also have a <code>PLUS</code> token that represents a &#43; sign, then the
									Grammar may specify the following: <code>INTEGER PLUS INTEGER</code>, which
									tells the Grammar if it gets an <code>INTEGER</code> token followed by
									<code>PLUS</code> token followed by another <code>INTEGER</code> token,
									then perform some specified action.
								</p>
								<p>
									In terms of my Python to C&#43;&#43; translator, my scanner consumes
									Python code, generates tokens using regular expressions, pushes
									the tokens to the Push-Parser, which then outputs the equivalent
									C&#43;&#43; code.

									This project is based off of the Linux Yocto Project.
									The Yocto Project is a Linux Foundation project whose goal is
									to make Linux distributions for embedded software independent
									of the underlying architecture of the embedded hardware. I changed
									the SLOB’s first-fit algorithm to a best-fit algorithm.
								</p>
								<p>
									SLOB stands for Simple List of Blocks and is one of the
									three memory allocators for the Linux kernel (if you don’t
									know what a kernel is, think of it as the operating system).
									The SLOB is designed for embedded software systems, and it
									is the default memory allocator in the Yocto Project. SLOB’s
									greatest weakness is its high memory fragmentation. This is
									because SLOB uses the first-fit algorithm for allocating memory.
									The first-fit algorithm allocates the first location of memory
									that is sufficient size for the needed memory, and doesn’t care
									about memory efficiency. If we were playing Tetris, the
									first-fit algorithm would just drop the tiles straight down,
									and when the tiles stacked to the top it would shift to an
									adjacent column and continue dropping tiles until that column
									is full. Where, the best-fit algorithm would play Tetris the
									way you’re supposed to. That is, placing the tiles (allocating
									memory) in the most space efficient manner.
								</p>
								<p>
									My findings were, well, what one would expect. The memory fragmentation
									decreased drastically, however, the time it took to allocate memory
									went up because the SLOB was now finding the best placement for the
									memory instead of just grabbing the first available opening.

								<hr>
								<p >
									At Autodesk, I worked in the Strategy and Research department under Patti Vrobel,
									Distinguished Research Engineer. We tackled a thin vertical into the idea of
									the computer as a collaborator as it applies to simulation.
								</p>
								<p>
										In the mechanical realm before designs can be manufactured and
										turned into products, they must first be simulated to assure
										the design meets the product's requirements. However,
										unless they are familiar with
										that product’s mechanics, they don’t know how to correctly
										set up the constraints and loads. Even if they get the
										constraints and loads set correctly most won’t know how
										to interpret the results. Because of this, many times
										minor designs are shipped off to the simulation analyst
										to be professionally tested. The simulation analyst will
										run the simulation, interpret the results, and then send
										the design back to the designer with critiques. Involving
										a simulation analyst often creates a bottleneck in process
										design. Not to mention, for minor designs this is a waste
										of company resources as the simulation analyst should be
										applying their knowledge to more complex designs.
								</p>
								<p >
									In collaboration with Patti Vrobel and my team at Autodesk,
									I designed and implemented a working prototype, Project Prospector,
									that runs in Autodesk’s Fusion 360 and attempts to solve this
									problem. Prospector automatically sets up and runs simulation
									in the background while the user is designing.
								</p>
								<p >
									Here's a high level overview of how Prospector works. The user is
									designing in Fusion 360. Behind the scenes Prospector scans
									their design, queries Design Graph (Autodesk's similarity tool)
									for similar parts and downloads
									them. Prospector then scans those files for past simulation studies
									and uses that info to automatically setup and run the simulation on
									the current design in the background. Imagine a chair being designed
									in Fusion 360. Prospector takes a snapshot of the design, ships it off
									to Design Graph which returns similar looking chairs. Those similar
									chairs are then mined for past simulation studies. Let’s say that
									Prospector came back and found that ChairSim1 was the best choice
									for the user's design. Then Prospector would prepare the user’s chair
									design for simulation using the info from ChairSim1. Once the simulation
									is done it is then shown to the designer. All of this is done behind the
									scene without user interaction.
								</p>
								<p >
									In the future, if we could filter the simulation’s contours
									to something that is easier for the designer to understand, we could
									increase a company’s productivity tremendously by cutting off the
									simulation analyst bottleneck. By shortening the time to manufacture,
									products get to market faster, increasing company revenues. Prospector
									allows the designer to design, the simulation analyst to simulate complex
									designs, and the computer to be used to its full advantage. By the end of the
									internship we had an awesome working prototype acting as a spark to kindle the
									innovation behind the computer as a collaborator, opening the eyes of many.

									<p>
										The current way internal Autodesk teams and Autodesk
										partners are saving materials and machine data has
										some problems. To upload this data, they must manually
										create a library and outline what structure the data
										must follow to be uploaded into the library. Once the
										library is created they need to structure their data
										to match the schema specified by the library. Then they
										write code to upload it to their newly created library.
										As you might have guessed, users need to be technically
										savvy to do this.
									</p>
									<p>
										Another problem that arises is the lack of versioning
										and access control. For example, imagine team A creates
										library "Steel" and for the next three years they add new
										facets to it. Then team B comes along and wants to utilize
										a portion of that library. To do that team B would have to
										import team A’s entire "Steel" library, even if they don’t
										need all the newly added facets. Not to mention every
										additional facet team B adds to "Steel" would affect all
										other teams utilizing that same library since they're
										pulling from the same place. That’s where the Manufacturing
										Data Service (MDS) comes in.
									</p>
									<p>
										MDS solves these problems by creating versioning and access
										control so each team can maintain their own library while still
										making a global registry for other teams to pick and choose what
										they would like from it. MDS also has a feature that allows for
										queries such as "I'm trying to 3-D print a part with this
										constraint. Give me a machine and material that would be
										able to do this for me." This tremendously boosts efficiency
										for internal teams and creates a mini marketplace for external
										partners that have uploaded their data. MDS also solves the
										obstacle of needing to be technically savvy and knowing what
										JSON schema is! This is solved by the Form Builder, which is
										where I spent my time.
									</p>
									<p>
										Form Builder is a web application that allows a user to create
										a data onboarding form through a quick and easy user interface.
										The form creator simply chooses which schemas/libraries they
										would like to import, selects the required and optional questions
										from those imports, arranges the questions, blocks, and tabs in
										the order they want them in, and optionally chooses input
										restrictions. Once that is all said and done- voila the form is
										created. Now the form creator can invite team members or clients
										to the form and start uploading data to MDS by simply filling
										out the form!
