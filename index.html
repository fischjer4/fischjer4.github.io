						<h4>Jeremy Fischer</h4>
						<p class="text-muted">
							I’m from a small farming community where I spent my summers working on our family fruit orchard. There is a joke that goes
							like this, “Do you know how to make a small fortune farming? Start out with a large fortune!” That’s because being
							a farmer is hard work and depending on the year it doesn’t always pay off, especially for we smaller growers. On a
							farm you are always trying to find the most efficient use of resources and figuring out how to fix things. I believe
							this is where my ingenuity and strong work ethic came from.
						</p>
						<p class="text-muted">
							I spent my winters at the ski resort 30 minutes from my home working as a ski and snowboard instructor as well as a Children’s
							Learning Center attendant. People from across the globe come to this mountain to work or to recreate, so I interacted
							with and learned to communicate well with people having all kinds of different personalities, temperaments and cultural
							backgrounds.
						</p>
						<p class="text-muted">
							I’ve always been an active individual and throughout middle school and high school I wrestled and played football. It was
							there that I learned the value of team. My experience was further enhanced as the team captain where I acquired an
							understanding of the importance of strong leadership and personal sacrifice for the sake of the greater good.
						</p>
						<p class="text-muted">
							I stumbled upon technology when I took a StRUT (Student use of Recycled Technology) class in high school. This class was
							more hardware based than software and mainly consisted of tinkering with Arduinos and dismantling broken computers.
							I became enlightened to what technology can do for people. I began researching career paths that involve technology.
							After exploring all options, I knew that I belonged in the Computer Science field. The fact that in Computer Science
							I can design, create, be the mastermind behind a solution that impacts people’s lives and really see it come to life
							excites me!
						</p>
						<p class="large text-muted">
							I’m in my third year now at Oregon State University and have been loving every bit of it. I have taken advantage of every
							opportunity I have encountered here at OSU and have been fortunate enough to be a part of the Engineering Leadership
							Academy and Oregon State’s ACM Student Chapter. I want to be a part of something that is challenging and innovative.
							I believe that my background, technical skill set, desire to learn, and involvement have set me up to excel in any
							situation that comes my way.

									New grads may be technically sound, but when it comes to 
									leadership and people skills many are falling short. The 
									Engineering Leadership Academy was developed by Scott Paja 
									and Industry partners to address that problem. The program 
									holds workshops for academy members hosted by successful 
									industry leaders who share their perspective on leadership 
									development, communication skills, work ethic, and ultimately
									what it takes to be an effective team member in their eyes. 
								</p>

									Jeremy created five small programs responsible for encrypting and decrypting text.
									The programs emulate a client server architecture where the <i>encrypt</i> program connects to the
									<i>decrypt</i> program via network sockets. When the <i>encrypt</i> program is 
									sent plaintext it generates a random key using the standard UNIX randomization methods to 
									encrypt the plaintext. When the encryption is done it sends back the ciphertext to the caller. 
									When the <i>decrypt</i> program is sent ciphertext and the generated key it returns the decrypted plaintext.

									As part of a five-person team Jeremy built a mini YouTube: Sound Tunnel.
									Logged in users can choose a genre which is represented by a circle that grows

									or the song list to choose a music video to view. The site also gives users the 
									ability to upload new videos.

									This was Jeremy's first real programming project. Being naive freshman, they built this

									At Autodesk, I worked in the Strategy and Research department under Pati Vrobel, 
									Distinguished Research Engineer. We tackled a thin vertical into the idea of 
									the computer as a collaborator as it applies to simulation. What I mean by 
									that is in the future, the computer will no longer be acting as a tool. 
									Rather, it will function more as a team member that takes on jobs, runs 
									those processes in the background, gives advice, and is more involved 
									overall in the experience. Think of Jarvis from Iron Man

										In the mechanical realm before designs can be manufactured and 
										turned into products, they must first be simulated to assure 
										the design meets the product's requirements. However, the 
										designer is frequently expected to set up the simulation 
										and more often than not, unless they are familiar with 
										that product’s mechanics, they don’t know how to correctly 
										set up the constraints and loads. Even if they get the 
										constraints and loads set correctly most won’t know how 
										to interpret the results. Because of this, many times 
										minor designs are shipped off to the simulation analyst 
										to be professionally tested. The simulation analyst will 
										run the simulation, interpret the results, and then send 
										the design back to the designer with critiques. Involving 
										a simulation analyst often creates a bottleneck in process 
										design. Not to mention, for minor designs this is a waste 
										of company resources as the simulation analyst should be 
										applying their knowledge to more complex designs.

									In collaboration with Patti Vrobel and my team at Autodesk, 
									I designed and implemented a working prototype, Project Prospector, 
									that runs in Autodesk’s Fusion 360 and attempts to solve this 
									problem. Prospector automatically sets up and runs simulation 
									in the background while the user is designing. Before I give an 
									overview of the project I need to introduce a very powerful utility 
									that made this possible - Design Graph. Design Graph is a project 
									coming out of Autodesk Research that uses machine learning and 
									shape recognition to scan designs for their parts and cluster them 
									based off of their geometry. For instance, all of the screws will 
									be in a cluster, the chairs in another, lamps in another, and so on. 
									Users can then explore these clusters when looking for part alternatives 
									by giving Design Graph their design and viewing all similar shaped alternatives.
								</p>
								<p class="align-normal">
									Here is a high level overview of how Prospector works. The user is 
									designing in Fusion 360. Behind the scenes Prospector scans 
									their design, queries Design Graph for similar parts and downloads 
									them. Prospector then scans those files for past simulation studies 
									and uses that info to automatically setup and run the simulation on 
									the current design in the background. Imagine a chair being designed 
									in Fusion 360. Prospector takes a snapshot of the design, ships it off 
									to Design Graph which returns similar looking chairs. Those similar 
									chairs are then mined for past simulation studies. Let’s say that 
									Prospector came back and found that ChairSim1 was the best choice 
									for the user's design. Then Prospector would prepare the user’s chair 
									design for simulation using the info from ChairSim1. Once the simulation 
									is done it is then shown to the designer. All of this is done behind the 
									scene without user interaction.
								</p>
								<p class="align-normal">
									This project espoused the idea of computer as collaborator in the simulation 
									realm. In the future, if we could filter the simulation’s contours 
									to something that is easier for the designer to understand, we could 
									increase a company’s productivity tremendously by cutting off the 
									simulation analyst bottleneck. By shortening the time to manufacture, 
									products get to market faster, increasing company revenues. Prospector 
									allows the designer to design, the simulation analyst to simulate complex 
									designs, and the computer to be used to its full advantage. By the end of the 
									internship we had an awesome working prototype acting as a spark to kindle the 
									innovation behind the computer as a collaborator, opening the eyes of many.
