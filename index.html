						<h4>Jeremy Fischer</h4>
						<p class="text-muted">
							I’m from a small farming community where I spent my summers 
							working on our family fruit orchard. There's a joke that goes
							like this, “Do you know how to make a small fortune farming? 
							Start out with a large fortune!” That’s because being
							a farmer is hard work and depending on the year it doesn’t 
							always pay off. On a farm you are always trying to find the most efficient use of 
							resources and figuring out how to fix broken equipment. I believe
							this is where my ingenuity and strong work ethic came from.
						</p>
						<p class="text-muted">
							I spent my winters at the ski resort 30 minutes from my 
							home working as a ski and snowboard instructor. People from across the globe 
							come to Mt. Hood to work or to recreate, so I interacted
							with people having all different personalities, 
							temperaments and cultural backgrounds.
						</p>
						<p class="text-muted">
							I’ve always been an active individual and throughout 
							my younger years I was a wrestler and a football player. It was
							there that I learned the value of team. My experience 
							was further enhanced as the team captain where I acquired an
							understanding of the importance of strong leadership and 
							personal sacrifice for the sake of the greater good.
						</p>
						<p class="text-muted">
							I stumbled upon technology when I took a StRUT (Student 
							use of Recycled Technology) class in high school. This class was
							more hardware based than software and mainly consisted of 
							tinkering with Arduinos and dismantling broken computers.
							I became enlightened to what technology can do for people. 
							I began researching career paths that involve technology.
							After exploring all options, I knew that I belonged in the 
							Computer Science field. The fact that in Computer Science
							I can design, create, be the mastermind behind a solution 
							that impacts people’s lives and really see it come to life
							excites me!
						</p>
						<p class="large text-muted">
							I’m in my final year now at Oregon State University 
							and have been loving every bit of it. I have taken advantage of every
							opportunity I have encountered here at OSU and have 
							been fortunate enough to be a part of the Engineering Leadership
							Academy and Oregon State’s ACM Student Chapter.

										<b>Disclaimer:</b> The Manufacturing Data Service 
										(MDS) is much more than described below. 
										I’m solely stating pieces of it to give 
										context to my contributions.
									</span>
									<hr>
									<p>
										The current way internal Autodesk teams and Autodesk 
										partners are saving materials and machine data has 
										some problems. To upload this data, they must manually 
										create a library and outline what structure the data 
										must follow to be uploaded into the library. Once the 
										library is created they need to structure their data 
										to match the schema specified by the library. Then they 
										write code to upload it to their newly created library. 
										As you might have guessed, users need to be technically 
										savvy to do this. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Another problem that arises is the lack of versioning 
										and access control. For example, imagine team A creates 
										library "Steel" and for the next three years they add new 
										facets to it. Then team B comes along and wants to utilize 
										a portion of that library. To do that team B would have to 
										import team A’s entire "Steel" library, even if they don’t 
										need all the newly added facets. Not to mention every 
										additional facet team B adds to "Steel" would affect all 
										other teams utilizing that same library since they're 
										pulling from the same place. That’s where the Manufacturing 
										Data Service (MDS) comes in.
									</p>
									<p>
										MDS solves these problems by creating versioning and access 
										control so each team can maintain their own library while still 
										making a global registry for other teams to pick and choose what 
										they would like from it. MDS also has a feature that allows for 
										queries such as "I'm trying to 3-D print a part with this 
										constraint. Give me a machine and material that would be 
										able to do this for me." This tremendously boosts efficiency 
										for internal teams and creates a mini marketplace for external 
										partners that have uploaded their data. MDS also solves the 
										obstacle of needing to be technically savvy and knowing what 
										JSON schema is! This is solved by the Form Builder, which is 
										where I spent my time.
									</p>
									<p>
										Form Builder is a web application that allows a user to create 
										a data onboarding form through a quick and easy user interface. 
										The form creator simply chooses which schemas/libraries they 
										would like to import, selects the required and optional questions 
										from those imports, arranges the questions, blocks, and tabs in 
										the order they want them in, and optionally chooses input 
										restrictions. Once that is all said and done- voila the form is 
										created. Now the form creator can invite team members or clients 
										to the form and start uploading data to MDS by simply filling 
										out the form!

								<h2>Project Prospector</h2>
								<p class="item-intro text-muted">
									Using archived designs similar in shape to 
									automatically run simulations behind the scenes
								</p>
								<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="images/modals/autoChairSim-full.png" alt="">
								<p >
									At Autodesk, I worked in the Strategy and Research department under Patti Vrobel, 
									Distinguished Research Engineer. We tackled a thin vertical into the idea of 
									the computer as a collaborator as it applies to simulation. 
								</p>
								<p>
										In the mechanical realm before designs can be manufactured and 
										turned into products, they must first be simulated to assure 
										the design meets the product's requirements. However,
										unless they are familiar with 
										that product’s mechanics, they don’t know how to correctly 
										set up the constraints and loads. Even if they get the 
										constraints and loads set correctly most won’t know how 
										to interpret the results. Because of this, many times 
										minor designs are shipped off to the simulation analyst 
										to be professionally tested. The simulation analyst will 
										run the simulation, interpret the results, and then send 
										the design back to the designer with critiques. Involving 
										a simulation analyst often creates a bottleneck in process 
										design. Not to mention, for minor designs this is a waste 
										of company resources as the simulation analyst should be 
										applying their knowledge to more complex designs.
								</p>
								<p >
									In collaboration with Patti Vrobel and my team at Autodesk, 
									I designed and implemented a working prototype, Project Prospector, 
									that runs in Autodesk’s Fusion 360 and attempts to solve this 
									problem. Prospector automatically sets up and runs simulation 
									in the background while the user is designing.
								</p>
								<p >
									Here's a high level overview of how Prospector works. The user is 
									designing in Fusion 360. Behind the scenes Prospector scans 
									their design, queries Design Graph (Autodesk's similarity tool) 
									for similar parts and downloads 
									them. Prospector then scans those files for past simulation studies 
									and uses that info to automatically setup and run the simulation on 
									the current design in the background. Imagine a chair being designed 
									in Fusion 360. Prospector takes a snapshot of the design, ships it off 
									to Design Graph which returns similar looking chairs. Those similar 
									chairs are then mined for past simulation studies. Let’s say that 
									Prospector came back and found that ChairSim1 was the best choice 
									for the user's design. Then Prospector would prepare the user’s chair 
									design for simulation using the info from ChairSim1. Once the simulation 
									is done it is then shown to the designer. All of this is done behind the 
									scene without user interaction.
								</p>
								<p >
									This project espoused the idea of computer as collaborator in the simulation 
									realm. In the future, if we could filter the simulation’s contours 
									to something that is easier for the designer to understand, we could 
									increase a company’s productivity tremendously by cutting off the 
									simulation analyst bottleneck. By shortening the time to manufacture, 
									products get to market faster, increasing company revenues. Prospector 
									allows the designer to design, the simulation analyst to simulate complex 
									designs, and the computer to be used to its full advantage. By the end of the 
									internship we had an awesome working prototype acting as a spark to kindle the 
									innovation behind the computer as a collaborator, opening the eyes of many.
